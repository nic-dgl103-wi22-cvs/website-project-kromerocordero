                    <img src="images/Ana.png" alt="Tattoo artist Ana Parker">
                    <p>Originally from Montreal, Quebec, Ana is a woman that comes from a family full of passion and admiration for the artistic side of life. They moved to Comox Valley when she was still young and once she grew older she settled in Courtenay. She was always passionate about drawing and finding her own style. Once she achieved that, people started noticing how fast she was improving and would sometimes give her commissions. Ana gladly dived into these projects and soon realized that this is what she wanted to do for the rest of her life. The passion for tattoos came after she met Harold and they&apos;ve been working together ever since.</p>

                    <img src="images/Harold.png" alt="Tattoo artist Harold Muller">
                    <p>Harold was born and raised in Courtenay. He has a similar upbringing to Ana&apos;s. He was usually the artsy kid, always doodling in class and wanting to get his hands into new crafts and new hobbies to pass time. Initially, he wanted to go to art school and pursue a career in the fine arts field, but a close friend of his suggested they go to a tattoo parlor to ask if they could become apprentices and learn from them. Being as curious as he was, Harold decided to partake in this little adventure and immediately felt a connection to tattoos as a form of art.</p>
